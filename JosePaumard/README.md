1. Is to show you language features from JDK8 to JDK13 and beyond
2. Jose Paumard Java 8 in depth.
# Links 

# NOTE
- Functinonal Interface has only one abstract method. You gotta feel why this is case
- `ayman.java.features` is NOT JosePaurmard-inspired. It handles new features of Java 8,9,10,11,12,13. It is inspied (copied) from JournalDev

## Default methods to Chain and Compose Functions
### Default Methods to Chain Lamdbas
### Default Methods to Combine Lamdbas
### Setup Generic Types of a Chained Function
NOTE: Ayman- I didn't understand one bit.
### Understanding difference b/w Chaining vs Composition
### Static Methods on Functional Interfaces to Create Lambdas

## Function Composition and Chaining to build COMPARATORS

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  Initial Comparator
2. Factory method of Comparator
3. Reverse Comparator
4. Make factory method generic
5. Use `default` to combine comparators.
6. Make fluent API
7. `Comparator.class` from JDK
